# 🌍 Real-Time Satellite Data Visualizer

**A Python tool that fetches real-time satellite event data from NASA's EONET API and overlays it on an interactive map with real-time weather updates from OpenWeatherMap.**  

## 🚀 Features
- 🌐 **Real-time satellite event tracking** (NASA EONET API)
- ☁️ **Live weather overlays** (temperature, humidity, and conditions)
- 🗺️ **Interactive maps** using **Folium** and **Plotly**
- 🔄 **Auto-refresh every 30 minutes**
- ✅ **Custom event filters** (category-based visualization)
